# Javascript Journey &middot; ![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg) ![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)

This is my very first javascript repository.
It is only for study purposes.

My goal is to understand how the following technologies works:

* **[Node JS](https://github.com/nodejs/node)** 
* **[React](https://github.com/facebook/react/)** 
* **[React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-NATIVE/)**

## Sources

The sources that I am been using will be listed here :)

* The javascript [STARTER PACK](https://skylab.rocketseat.com.br/journey/starter) by [RocketSeat](https://rocketseat.com.br/). 

<!-- 

AND THIS IS MY EXAMPLE OF HOW MAKE A GOOD README.md.
Took it from REACT github.

## Examples

We have several examples [on the website](https://reactjs.org/). Here is the first one to get you started:

```jsx
function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <HelloMessage name="Taylor" />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);
```
